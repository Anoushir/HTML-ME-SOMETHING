                    <p>
                        "The 1992 Plymouth Laser was technically both my third and sixth car. The first being 
                        bought aroung age 19. Lacking automotive knowledge I learned to work specifcally on
                         DSM's (Diamond Star Motors). The second Laser I purchased at age 25. Now equipped with 
                         knowledge and a little more money, I built the car I still own today, Falecia. Pictured below
                         went 11.63 @123mph. Since has gained a larger HX40 turbo and has been swapped to automatic transmission.

                    <p>
                        "In September of 2005 I finally had turned 16 and was on the search for my first car. Though the
                        Lincoln held a 4.6 liter V8 engine, it was not the ideal car for a race spirited 16 year old. However
                        I learned a lot about this platform. Ultimately this car introduced me to the realm of the internet. I 
                        accessed forums to help diagnose issues I was having. In the end with very basic bolt ons the car went 
                        14.8 @97mph. I was ecstatic at the time."

                        "I had sold all of my 'race cars' and just graduating from automotive trade school in Chicago.
                        I was on the lookout for a new car, I wanted something new entirely. I found a fourth generation
                        LS1 Camaro. It had 68k miles and was as clean as they come. The car was mostly built by the previous
                        owner. Consisted of a fairly large head/cam combination. Eventually this car went 11.64 @ 122mph. Which
                        at the time was the fastest car I'd ever owned or driven."

                        "My second car was a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse. With this car I learned a lot about forced induction,
                        maintenance, and traction. This car was not great to me however many times the issues were operator
                        error. This was my first Turbo Charged vehicle also my first of many 4g63 engine. The engine I would base
                        my automotive racing path apon."

                    <p>
                        The 2007 Suzuki GSX-R was an incredible machine. It was stunning, a perfect white and blue combination
                        , graphics removed. Great sound and even better performance. The Suzuki opened my eyes to what would
                         eventually be another passion of mine. Twisty roads and perfect apex's

                    <p>
                        An all around awesome machine. The CX500 was the first V twin motor in a Honda motorcycle.
                        My wife Katie purchased this Honda for me on my 25th birthday. At the time I liked the style
                        of cafe racers and had plans to mold the bike into something simlar. Plans changed drastically 
                        over the years. I ended up with a mix of all sorts. But an absolute blast to ride and gets 
                        attention everywhere I take it.

                        The most recent build is my 1976 Honda CB550. Purchased recently as a project for my wife Katie.
                        The hope is to restore the bike to a reliable good looking cruiser. One she can learn to ride on
                        and still be enough to not grow out of immediately. Still work to be done on this one.

                    <p>
                        My most recent purchase is this 2017 Yamaha FZ-09. Best performing bike I've ever had the priveladge
                        to ride. Triple cylinder 845cc engine delivers over 120hp and 76ftlb. of torque. I've done minor modifications
                        but have only owned the bike a short time. More to come.
